# UTC Data Mining Test
## Introduction
A tool supports data mining assignments in [UTC](https://utc.edu.vn)

## Features
1. Mean, medium, mode
2. Boxplot
3. Normalize min-max
4. Normalize z-score
5. Normalize z-score by mean absolute deviant
6. Normalize decimal scaling
7. Correlation coefficient
8. Smooth data by equal-width binning
8. Smooth data by equal-frequency binning

I will try to update the rest as soon as possible '-')>
